        <p>Based on wide-ranging testing and consultation, this set of questions is intended as a starting point to constructive engagement at any mine site, big or small, and for local communities, civil society, workers, trade unions, local government and others wishing to engage in a constructive way on what one can reasonably expect from mine sites in most environments.</p>
        <p>Following the publication of the first RMI Report in 2018, it is the result of numerous requests from mining-affected groups around the world for an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand tool. A tool to enter into dialogue with mining companies on some of the matters that directly affect communities and workers in and around a mine.</p>
        <p>The selection of topics and issues covered is not comprehensive, but local stakeholders can follow a similar approach to address any other mining-related matter of interest.</p>
        <p>The Mine Site Assessment Tool (MSAT) is free to use by anyone, even a mine manager seeking to engage on the fundamental issues affecting a mine siteâ€™s neighbours.</p>
